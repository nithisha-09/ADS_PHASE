PROJECT TITLE : PREDICTING IMDb SCORES
PROBLEM DEFINITION: The "Predicting IMDb Movie Scores" project seeks to harness the power of machine learning to forecast IMDb ratings for movies. IMDb scores play a pivotal role in guiding viewers' movie choices and are of paramount importance to the film industry. This project endeavours to construct an accurate predictive model that can provide insights to filmmakers, distributors, and movie enthusiasts. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate IMDb scores for movies. IMDb scores are a widely recognized metric for evaluating the quality of movies, and accurate prediction can provide valuable insights to movie studios, distributors, and viewers alike. The project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to build a robust prediction model.
DESIGN THINKING: To create a predictive model for IMDb scores, you would typically gather a dataset that includes these features and their corresponding IMDb scores. Machine learning techniques, such as regression or ensemble models, can then be applied to train the model for prediction. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline in data science. Data preprocessing means to prepare the data for classification. Data is processed according to the requirements of classification.In this project I can also use Feature engineering. Feature engineering is critical when predicting IMDb scores for movies. Selecting the right model for predicting IMDb scores or analyzing IMDb data involves understanding your specific problem, the data you have, and your objectives. IMDb scores typically involve regression tasks, where you predict a continuous target variable (movie ratings). Model training for predicting IMDb scores typically involves a regression task, as you're trying to predict a continuous target variable (movie ratings). Evaluating the performance of a predictive model for IMDb scores is crucial to understand how well the model is performing and to make any necessary improvements.
BUILDING THE PROGRAM : I used feature engineering to build my project. Feature engineering refers to the process of using domain knowledge to select and transform the most relevant variables from raw data when creating a predictive model using machine learning or statistical modeling. .FEATURE ENGINEERING have some common techniques….. In this we are using feature selection (statistical test) T-TEST is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a process or treatment actually has an effect on the population of interest or whether two groups are different from one another. 
MODEL TRAINING is a fundamental step in machine learning where you teach your model to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions. MODEL TRAINING aims to build the best mathematical representation of the relationship between data and a target (supervised) or among the data itself (unsupervised). After preprocessing the dataset , We are using Feature extraction method which are typically using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
EVALUATION : Evaluating the model’s performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE). Evaluation provides feedback to help to identify if the training achieved the intended outcomes, and helps to make decisions about future trainings.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our IMDb score prediction model has shown promising results and demonstrated the potential to accurately estimate the IMDb scores of movies. Through extensive data collection, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, we have developed a robust model that can be a valuable tool for various stakeholders in the film industry, including movie producers, studios, and critics.
